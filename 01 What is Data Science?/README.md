Data scientists use data analysis to add to the knowledge of the organization by investigating data, exploring the best way to use it to provide value to the business. Data scientists can analyze structured and unstructured data from many sources, and depending on the nature of the problem, they can choose to analyze the data in different ways. Using multiple models to explore the data reveals patterns and outliers; sometimes, this will confirm what the organization suspects, but sometimes it will be completely new knowledge, leading the organization to a new approach. 
When the data has revealed its insights, the role of the data scientist becomes that of a storyteller, communicating the results to the project stakeholders. Data scientists can use powerful data visualization tools to help stakeholders understand the nature of the results, and the recommended action to take. Data Science is changing the way we work; it's changing the way we use data and itâ€™s changing the way organisations understand the world.
